/**
 * # About value classes
 * A value class in Kotlin (`@JvmInline value class`) is a wrapper around a single property
 * that does **not** introduce a separate object at runtime (when optimizations are applied).
 * Instead, the underlying value (here: `UInt`) is used directly wherever possible.
 *
 * This gives you:
 * - **Type safety** – `Euro` can’t be mixed up with a plain `UInt` by accident.
 * - **No runtime overhead** – no extra allocation compared to using a bare `UInt`.
 * - **Cleaner domain modeling** – code reads in terms of `Euro`, `Item`, `Shop`, etc.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - A value class can only wrap **one property**.
 * - They cannot have backing fields or inheritance hierarchies.
 * - Boxing may still occur in some cases (e.g. generics, reflection).
 *
 * # Why here?
 * Money amounts are stored in integer cents (UInt) to avoid floating-point rounding errors.
 * Wrapping them in a value class makes the type distinct and prevents accidental misuse.

/**
 * NOTE on underflow/overflow:
 * - Using UInt means arithmetic wraps on underflow/overflow.
 *   In + and * this can overflow for large totals.
 * - For robust production code check for underflows/overflows!
 * - We are clamping at 0 and ignore overflows, which is fine for our use-case.
 *   In a real world use-case this can be problematic!
