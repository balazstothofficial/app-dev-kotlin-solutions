/**
 * # Functions
 * Probably the most important topic in this lecture.
 * We start by looking at top-level functions.
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - Write a top-level function `math`, which takes two [Int]s and returns an [Int].
 *  Use and understand the +, -, *, /, and % operators to calculate something.
 *  Return the result using the `return` keyword.
 *  Call it with two values and print its result.
 * - Write a top-level function `formula`, which takes two booleans and returns a boolean.
 *  The second argument should have a default value.
 *  Use and understand the &&, ||, and ! operators to combine the parameters somehow.
 *  Return the result without using the `return` keyword.
 *  Call it with one values as named argument and print its result.
 *
